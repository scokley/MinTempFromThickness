# MinTempFromThickness

Raw miniumum surface temperature prediction from numerical weather prediction models are known to be limited at times by inherent model limitations and bias. Forecasters have used low level thickness values, the difference in height of the 1000 mb and 850 mb surfaces, to help indicate accurate ranges for minimum temperatures.

This notebook will explore using thickness values to predict minimum temperature for Greensboro, NC (GSO), and the improvements possible with the addition of variables like mean sea level pressure (MSLP), and precipitable water (PW). Predictions could be created by using model derived forecasts of these variables.
